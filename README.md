# Convolution-Of-Images<br>
***The test weights, and test images are attched*** <br>
Defining a ConvNet class with the following class members:<br>
(1) one data member for storing the output of each layer where the first layer stores the result of reading the input image data (32x32x3 array of floating point numbers) and the last layer stores the output of the ConvNet (which is the probability of the 10 classes), <br>
(2) one method/function member to compute the output of each of the layers from 2 to the last layer. <br><br>
***Stage 1 Input***<br>
1)  Layer L1 : input layer <br>
a)	Data member D1:  float 3D matrix array of size 32x32x3 to store input image.<br>
b)	Method member M1: reads input file and initializes the input layer in 1a.<br>

***Stage 2: First Conv+ReLU+Max pool***<br>
2)  Layer L2 : Convolution, Stride 1 <br>
a. Data member D2: 32x32x16 array of floating point numbers to store the output of L2 <br>
b. Data member D3:  5x5x3x16 array for storing the 16 convolution filters with zero padding.<br>
c. Data member D4: 16x1 array for storing the bias vector<br>
d. Method member M2: for reading input file to initialize the data member D3 in L2.<br>
e. Method member M3: for reading input file to initialize the data member D4 in L2.<br>
f. Method M4 : for computing the data member D2 by convolving D1 with D3 and adding D4, and storing the output in D2. Set Stride = 1.<br><br>

3)	Layer L3: ReLu activation function <br>
a.	Data member D5: 32x32x16 array for storing the output of this layer L3.<br>
b.	Method member M5: Computes D5 using D2. Z= max(0,x).<br>
4)	Layer L4: Maxpooling: filter size 2x2, stride=2. <br>
a.	Data member D6: 16x16x16 array for storing the output of this layer L4.<br>
b.	Method member M6: Process D5 to compute and store D6. Each element is the maximum of 4 elements in a 2x2 block, with stride 2.<br>
The way this CNN works is such that it considers max-pooling of 2x2 regions in 2D cross-sections of 3D arrays, for each cross-section separately. Only 2D max pooling is used. For example, the first max pooling in layer L4 does the following:<br>
Input: D5: 32x32x16 say D5[m][n][k]<br>
Output: D6: 16x16x16, say D6[i][j][k]<br>
Stride: 2<br>

c.	Method M21: for each element x of normalized D17, compute the corresponding softmax function of x that gives itâ€™s probability: ( exp(x)/(sum of exp(xi) for all i).
d.	Method M22: Method that prints the output of this CNN stored in D20.<br><br>
Main function creates a ConvNet object defined above, and calls methods to initialize the input, filters, and bias vectors, and then calls the methods to compute the output of layers in sequence, and prints the output to a file. <br>
